This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` component with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function.  The issue is that the function might not be called consistently, or it might be called with unexpected behavior. For example, the scanned barcode data might be incorrect, duplicated, or missing entirely.

```javascript
// buggy code
<Camera type={Camera.Constants.Type.back} onBarCodeScanned={({ type, data }) => {
console.log('Barcode scanned:', type, data);
//process data here
}} />
```
